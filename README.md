# 100daysofML

Repository for python code and projects during my 100 days of ML learning. Updated regularly.

Day 1 - I was already enrolled in the udemy course, Tensorflow and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp on Udemy.
        Topic - Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction.

Day 2 - Autoencoders - Image reconstruction and cleaning.

Day 3 - GANs - What, Why and How to implement GANs for image generation.

Day 4 - ML Deployment using Flask HTML. I am more inclined towards using streamlit as it is easier to code and deploy.

Day 5 - Started the course - Master Computer Vision with OpenCV4.
        Reading / Writing images using openCV.
        Color spaces.

Day 6 - Image manipulation using Affine and non affine transformations.
        Image translations, rotations, scaling and resizing.

Day 7 - Arithmetics on Images and how it impacts the image output.
        Image masking, blurring, edge detection using canny.
        Project #1 - Sketch generator via webcam feed.

Day 8 - Image segmentation and contours

Day 9 - Approximating contours, matching shapes, finding convex contours

Day 10 - Finding lines, blob detection, Object detection intro (Small project to find the object in a image using Template Matching),
        Object matching using webcam using ORB matcher.

Day 11 - HOG (Histogram of Gradients), Using haarcascade classifiers for car, face, body in videos and live webcam feeds

Day 12 - Facial landmark detection, Project - Yawn detector, Written number classifier

Day 13 - Face recognition project

Day 14 - Object tracking, CAMShift and MeanShift tracking.

Day 15 - Start - Automatic number plate recognition, Computer Vision and deep learning, Digit recognition with CNN+OpenCV

These topics are part of the computer vision course I am going through. Cover a high level information.
Day 16 - Intro NN, Activation functions, Forward propagation, Loss functions, Steps for training  NN,
Back propagation and Gradient Descent, Regularization (L1[Lasso], L2[Ridge]), Cross Validation, Early Stopping, Dropout, Image/Data Augmentation, Epochs and batch sizes, Performance and Confusion matrix.

Day 17 - Convolution NN, Convolutions, Image features, convolution process, Depth, Stride and Padding, ReLu (max(o,x)), Pooling [Max / Average]        

Day 18 - Training a CNN using tensorflow on MNIST dataset, Train test splits on Image data, Cat vs dog classifier, Data augmentation for improving the model

Day 19 - OpenCV Course completed. Explainable Machine Learning using LIME.

Day 20 - Recurrent Neural networks from the book - Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow)
