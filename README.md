Day 8 - Image segmentation and contours

Day 9 - Approximating contours, matching shapes, finding convex contours

Day 10 - Finding lines, blob detection, Object detection intro (Small project to find the object in a image using Template Matching),
        Object matching using webcam using ORB matcher.

Day 12 - Facial landmark detection, Project - Yawn detector, Written number classifier

Day 13 - Face recognition project

Day 14 - Object tracking, CAMShift and MeanShift tracking.

Day 15 - Start - Automatic number plate recognition, Computer Vision and deep learning, Digit recognition with CNN+OpenCV
